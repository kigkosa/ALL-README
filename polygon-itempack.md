Test on 1.20.2

For packs that include wings, hats, and backpacks, I recommend using the cosmetics plugin that I provide, which is CosmeticsCore. And for crates and keys, I suggest using plugins like random chest or ExcellentCrates.

Armor Set: You cannot change to a different set. It must be a leather set only because Leather Armor is a dyed set of various colors combined.

Some weapon models cannot be crafted into specific weapons, such as the trident, because the trident is a game-defined entity set as is.
